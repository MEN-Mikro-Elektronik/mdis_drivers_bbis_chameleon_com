       expecting root device on bus 0
   2. CfgInfo(BBIS_CFGINFO_ADDRSPACE): break with error code BBIS_ILL_SLOT
      in case the device does not exist

[ 2008-07-11 09:17:51 by dpfeuffer ]
- bb_chameleon.c
  R:1. CHAMELEON_BrdInit did not free all ressources on exit
    2. when group was first DEV in BBIS descriptor (Slot 0) it was ignored
    3. descriptor said group has 2 devices; driver would look for *_MAX_DEVS
    4. example for descriptor showed DESC lib internal view (GROUP_1/GROUP_ID)
    5. when a group was detected always _MAX_DEVS*CHAMELEONV2_UNIT
        structures where allocated, independant of how many where needed
    6. when compiled with VS 2008: some casting errors were occured
    7. PCI chameleon FPGA was restricted to function=0 location
  M:1 call chamFuncTbl.Term when handle still valid on exit
